Minimal Chess game using zig 0.15.2 and raylib-zig bindings.
This game does not include many of the rules to end the game for simplicity.
For example, it does not have detection for 50-move rule or 75-move rule. But, these rules are not
difficult to implement anyway!
Feel free to suggest improvements specially for existing bugs.
